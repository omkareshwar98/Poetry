***** The Silent Resilience *****

A weight unseen, it rests so deep,
A silent ache he dares not speak.
Each day a mask, a careful smile,
But inside she’s lost by many miles.

She feels the world’s unspoken gaze,
Trapped within life’s endless maze.
The fear of judgment, sharp and near,
Keeps him bound by silent fear.

How can she rise, break from the mold,
When voices around him seem so cold?
Yet whispers stir within his mind,
"You're more than this, seek and find."

So step by step, she'll shed the weight,
Reclaim his path, rewrite his fate.
For freedom lies in letting go,
In standing tall, and letting flow.

One breath, one choice, to take a stand,
A spark that grows to light the land.
The fear fades slow, but strength takes hold,
And he becomes her story told.
